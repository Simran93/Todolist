# Todolist : This app allows to create new to-do lists and all the data is persisted locally on the device using Userdefaults and CoreData.
 For instance, you can make  different sections like shopping, travelling, work etc.
 You can tick the items off and swipe to delete them, search any item from the to-do list. AS the number of items gets increased, the colour of items in a section gets darker and darker.

Functionality Used: 
UITableViewController, TableView Delegate methods, creating a text field inside UIAlert,
persistent local data storage, user defaults, configure core data with SQLite database backend,
implementing UISearchBar, setting up category view controller, fetching, updating and 
removing data from Realm, creating gradient flow cells.
